# lunapp

Website LunApp established for business which sells with garages and barriers automation. Data in used in project are examples.

I used in project HTML5 with methology BEM, CSS with preprocessor SASS and I created button 'hamburger' in JavaScript. 
Usually to position the elements i applied property flexbox.
Website is fully responsive.

Headers, in every each HTML, are the same, becouse I will add in the future slider with photos.
All IMG are examples to insert photos in the future - Each properties 'alt' are empty, to insert in the future after add photos.

The website has 3 subpages - index.html - home with information about firm; 
oferta.html - offers items with photos (black square replacing photos);
kontakt.html with contact e-mail, facebook and telephone number.
